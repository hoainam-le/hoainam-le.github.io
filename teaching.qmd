## Florida Atlantic University  

I am currently a GTA in the Mathematical Department, where I have the opportunity to teach and tutor undergraduate students in various subjects. Teaching helps me deepen my understanding, as it requires clear and careful explanations. It is also one of my passions and was part of my minor during my bachelor’s studies.
