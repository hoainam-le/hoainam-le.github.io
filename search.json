    "text": "Number field\nLet \\(K\\) be a number field, i.e., a finite extension of \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). Since \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is perfect, the extension \\(K/\\mathbb{Q}\\) is separable. Thus, every number field is a finite separable extension of \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). By the Primitive Element Theorem, \\(K\\) is a simple extension, so there exists \\(\\alpha \\in K\\) such that \\(K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)\\). Since \\(K/\\mathbb{Q}\\) is finite, \\(\\alpha\\) is algebraic over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\).\nMoreover, there exists a non-zero \\(c \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\) such that \\(c\\alpha = \\theta\\), where \\(\\theta\\) is an algebraic integer. Hence, \\[K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\theta).\n\\]\nLet \\(m_{\\theta,\\mathbb{Q}}(x)\\) be the minimal polynomial of \\(\\theta\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) of degree \\(n\\), and let \\(\\theta_1, \\dots, \\theta_n\\) (with \\(\\theta = \\theta_1\\)) denote its distinct roots in \\(\\mathbb{C}\\) (all roots are distinct because of the separability of \\(K\\)). Then there are exactly \\(n\\) distinct field embeddings (monomorphisms) \\(\\sigma_i: K \\to \\mathbb{C}\\) \\((i = 1, \\dots, n)\\) such that \\(\\sigma_i(\\theta) = \\theta_i\\).\nWe observe that \\(\\sigma_i(K) \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}\\) if and only if \\(\\sigma_i(\\theta) \\in \\mathbb{R}\\). In this case, \\(\\sigma_i\\) is said to be real; otherwise, it is called complex.\nSince complex conjugation \\(\\tau: \\mathbb{C} \\to \\mathbb{C}\\) is a field automorphism, the composition \\[\n\\overline{\\sigma}_i := \\tau \\circ \\sigma_i: K \\to \\mathbb{C} \\to \\mathbb{C}\n\\] defined by \\(\\overline{\\sigma}_i(\\theta) = \\overline{\\sigma_i(\\theta)}\\), is also a field embedding. Thus, \\(\\overline{\\sigma}_i = \\sigma_j\\) for some \\(1 \\leq j \\leq n\\).\nMoreover, since \\(\\tau(x) = x\\) if and only if \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) and \\(\\overline{\\overline{\\sigma}_i} = \\sigma_i\\), we have that \\(\\sigma_i\\) is real if and only if \\(\\sigma_i = \\overline{\\sigma}_i\\). In particular, the complex embeddings always occur in conjugate pairs.\nTherefore, if \\(r_1\\) is the number of real embeddings and \\(2r_2\\) is the number of complex embeddings (which come in pairs), then the total number of embeddings is \\(n = r_1 + 2r_2\\). Let’s denote \\[\n\\sigma_1\\cdots, \\sigma_{r_1},\\tau_{1},\\overline{\\tau}_1,\\cdots, \\tau_{r_2},\\overline{\\tau}_{r_2}\n\\] are all monomorphisms from \\(K\\to \\mathbb{C}\\).\nFurthermore, the direct product \\(\\mathbb{R}^{r_1} \\times \\mathbb{C}^{r_2}\\) is a vector space over \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) of dimension \\(r_1 + 2r_2 = n\\) (this is also a ring with componentwise operations i.e., \\(\\mathbb{R}^{r_1} \\times \\mathbb{C}^{r_2}\\) is an \\(\\mathbb R\\)-algebra). We define a map: \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\sigma:&\\ K\\to \\mathbb{R}^{r_1}\\times \\mathbb{C}^{r_2}\\\\\n&x\\mapsto (\\sigma_1(x),\\cdots,\\sigma_{r_1}(x),\\tau_1(x),\\cdots,\\tau_{r_2}(x))\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThis is a \\(\\mathbb Q\\)-algebra homomorphism, so \\(\\sigma\\) is either the zero map or injective. Since \\(\\sigma(1) = (1, \\dots, 1) \\neq 0\\), \\(\\sigma\\) must be injective. In other words, this map embeds \\(K\\) into \\(\\mathbb{R}^{r_1} \\times \\mathbb{C}^{r_2}\\) as a subring.\nNow suppose we view \\(\\mathbb{R}^{r_1} \\times \\mathbb{C}^{r_2}\\cong \\mathbb R^n\\) as a vector space over \\(\\mathbb R\\). Since each \\(\\tau_i(x) \\in \\mathbb{C}\\) can be written as \\(\\operatorname{Re}(\\tau_i(x)) + i\\,\\operatorname{Im}(\\tau_i(x))\\), we can write the map above as \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\sigma:&\\ K\\to \\mathbb{R}^{n}\\\\\n&x\\mapsto (\\sigma_1(x),\\cdots,\\sigma_{r_1}(x),\\operatorname{Re}(\\tau_1(x)),\\operatorname{Im}(\\tau_1(x)),\\cdots,\\operatorname{Re}(\\tau_{r_2}(x)),\\operatorname{Im}(\\tau_{r_2}(x)))\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNote that this \\(\\sigma\\) is an \\(\\mathbb{R}\\)-vector space homomorphism. The following results still hold even when we view \\(\\sigma\\) as an \\(\\mathbb{R}\\)-vector space homomorphism.\nTheorem: The image of finite generated subgroup of \\((K,+)\\) under \\(\\sigma\\) is a lattice in \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\). In particular, if \\(G = \\langle\\omega_1,\\cdots,\\omega_m\\rangle_{\\mathbb{Z}}\\subseteq (K,+)\\), then \\(\\sigma(G)\\) is a lattice with generators \\(\\{\\sigma(\\omega_1),\\cdots,\\sigma(\\omega_m)\\}\\)."
